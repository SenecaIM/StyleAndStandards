Styles and standards of the controls layout in applications:

The font used by Seneca Investment Managers in general is Microsoft Sans Serif.
The size of the font will vary depending on the purpose.
Gerenal size of the font will be 8.25pt.

The controls spacing will also vary depending on the screen layout and purpose.

General rules will include:

-Control should be placed 3px off the left border of the form/screen/control to keep a little bit of space 
between the control and the border of the form.

-The space left between controls anchored to each other should equal to 6px or more depending on the control size.

-The spacing between separated controls that serve different functions and purpose should be more than 20px 
this is to keep the controls separated from each other so that the user is not confused using them 
and they are clear to read.


Colours and design patterns:

-The colour of the font should be black unless there will be a meaning behind having a different coloured font

-Colours purple and green should not be used as meaningful as these are the company colours and might cause
design interferrence or bad look.

-Colour red, yellow and green are not to be used unless meaning something.

Consistency will be the key factor when it comes to creating or placing controls in Seneca Investment Managers systems.
Users should not get confused when using controls, so the layout on the screen should be easy to use.
